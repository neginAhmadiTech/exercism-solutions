# Exercism Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to coding exercises from [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/).

Each folder corresponds to a programming language track I’m studying on Exercism.
Exercises are organized by their official names within each language.

## 📁 Structure

```
exercism-solutions/
├── javascript/   # JavaScript track solutions
├── python/       # Python track solutions
└── go/           # Go track solutions
```

## 🚀 How I Work

I use the Exercism CLI to download, solve, and submit exercises.
My local Exercism workspace is configured to point directly to this repository so I can version-control my progress and share it publicly.

<!-- ### Example

```bash
# Download an exercise
``` -->
